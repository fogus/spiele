# Card Games - volume 1

In 2018 I gathered together the rules for a few of the card games that I desgined over the years and bound them into a little pamphlet:

This pamphlet was printed in limited quantities and sent to friends and family as a holday gift. The games included are listed below.

* *Cardening* - a bidding trick-taking game for 2-3 players.
* *Undermine* - an auction game for exactly 3 players.
* *Spec* - a commodities speculation card game for 3-5 players.
* *Vizzini* - a bluffing game for exactly 2 players.
* *Go Goya* - a trick-taking/avoidance game for 2-5 players.
* *Tori-Poker* - a truncated Poker for children.
* *Broken Hearts* - various house rules for the masterful game of Hearts.
* *Imo* - a re-imagining of UNO for 4 players in 2 partnerships.

Little feedback was received and I doubt that the games were played, so for now these games will live only in the confines of my own home.
